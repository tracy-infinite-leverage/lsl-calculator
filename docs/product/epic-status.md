## Pipeline stages

| Stage | Gate question |
|-------|---------------|
| 1 · Specified | Is there a written spec with acceptance criteria? |
| 2 · In flight | Is active development underway? |
| 3 · Feature-complete | Does it meet every acceptance criterion? |
| 4 · Tested | Have all tests passed? |
| 5 · Shipped | Is it deployed and measurably impacting users? |

| Epic | Status | % done (est) | Pipeline | Open bugs | Closed bugs | Notes |
|------|--------|--------------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| E1 · NSW Calculator | ☐ planned | 0% | ○○○○○ | 0 | 0 | NSW locked as first state (2026-05-21). Hosting model = standalone + deep-link (working default). Spec to be written. |
| E2 · All-State Coverage | ☐ planned | 0% | ○○○○○ | 0 | 0 | Blocked on E1 proving the rules-engine pattern on NSW. |
| E3 · Audit Upload and Variance Report | ☐ planned | 0% | ○○○○○ | 0 | 0 | Moved ahead of API integrations on PM direction (2026-05-21). CSV-only ingest. |

## Drilldown

### E1 · NSW Calculator
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Pre-flight blockers**: APA portal hosting + auth model (working default: standalone + deep-link); quality-gate sign-off process (see Open Decisions in product.md)
- **Next action**: run `pm-epic-writing` full workflow (speckit-specify → clarify → analyze → epic) on E1 to produce `.specify/features/001-nsw-calculator/spec.md`

### E2 · All-State Coverage
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Blocked on**: E1 reaching Stage 5 (Shipped) or at least Stage 4 (Tested) on NSW
- **Next action**: hold until E1 ships, then specify per-state work packages in priority order

### E3 · Audit Upload and Variance Report
- **Phase**: Phase 1
- **Pre-flight blockers**: audit data acquisition path (see Open Decisions in product.md)
- **Next action**: hold until E1 NSW rules engine is stable, then specify CSV import + replay + variance report

### E4 · Payroll System Integrations
- **Phase**: Phase 2
- **Pre-flight blockers**: first payroll-vendor selection; OAuth/API access agreements with vendor
- **Next action**: hold until E2 has at least 2-3 states encoded and E3 audit-replay is in production
